Problem 1:
A* search algorithm on the Romania Map route-finding problem with SLD heuristic. Oradea to Bucharest:  

What route was found:  
CurrentLocation=In(Oradea), Goal=In(Bucharest)  
Action[name==moveTo, location==Sibiu]  
Action[name==moveTo, location==RimnicuVilcea]  
Action[name==moveTo, location==Pitesti]  
Action[name==moveTo, location==Bucharest]  

How many nodes expanded:  
METRIC[nodesExpanded]=5  

What was path cost:  
METRIC[pathCost]=429.0  

Problem 2:
